A reupload, but currently being fixed of swagging-post's stolen Blooket Cheats, as well as-

THE BEST, PRO, BLOOKET CHEAT GUI OUT THERE!

UPDATES | V2.1
We are we currently working on the Laser Tag gamemode to bypass. This may take a bit but it isn't expected to at all work.
Icons are expected to be fixed later.
GUI Now Managed By noahyy

#Information

How to use
There are 2 good methods to using these scripts:

Copying the main GUI and running it in the inspect element console
Copying the .min.js GUI and using it as a bookmarklet

What can I do if JavaScript is blocked?
We don't actually know what to do about this or how to fix it, sorry.

(script) is not working?
Make sure you're running it properly (see How to use), if it still doesn't work and other cheats do, then make an issue

Which script should I use to make a bookmarklet?
You should use the scripts ending in ".min.js", as using the others will have errors due to formatting.

Can you give me infinite tokens / bypass daily limit / permanently give me blooks / change pack luck?
No, these are things we would've already done if they were possible, they're managed on the backend of Blooket so we can't modify them

Can you make hacks for (game)
No

Can you make more Battle Royale cheats
Battle Royale is a gamemode that works almost entirely on the host's end. The only thing we have control over is answering questions.

How do I do this on mobile?
These scripts aren't made for mobile, so we don't really know how to get them to work on it.

What's the Mobile GUI?
The mobile GUI is the first GUI Minesraft2 ever made. Some people said it worked on mobile and it's a lot neater for mobile use apparently so we just called it that.
